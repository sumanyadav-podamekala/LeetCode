628. Maximum Product of Three Numbers

class Solution:
    def maximumProduct(self, nums):
        nums.sort()  # Sort the numbers in ascending order
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Calculate the product of the three largest numbers
        max_product = nums[n - 1] * nums[n - 2] * nums[n - 3]
        
        # Calculate the product of the two smallest numbers and the largest number
        min_product = nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[n - 1]
        
        # Return the maximum of max_product and min_product
        return max(max_product, min_product)
